1.2.4

  - added reverbration effect for masking audio drop-outs. A switch was
    added to the evaluation dialog to enable or disable this feature.
  - added error detection for SDC channel (show yellow light (LED) if SDC data seems to be corrupted)
  - bug fix: when SDC data was used completley the CRC was read as length
    of entity data which was wrong. Now, the length of data read is checked
    whether it has reached the total number of bits available
  - do not show bit-rate in service selector label if bit-rate is zero
  - apply hanning window to input spectrum plot
  - use lower value of Doppler for initialization phase of Wiener filter in
    time direction (aliasing peaks in impulse response are lower now are
    re-synchronization)
  - use shorter filter lengths for Wiener filtering for channel estimation
    in time direction
  - improved initialization phase for DRM frame synchronization
  - Only use DRM frame synchronization based on time pilots since the
    algorithm based on the impulse response does not perform well in
    case of a very long IR
  - added waterfall display for input spectrum
  - use smaller buffers to speed up audio output after re-synchronization
  - for long symbol interleaving, try to decode data before the whole
    interleaver buffer is filled by setting the uninitialized symbols
    to erasure
  - bug fix for time-sync-acquisition initialization
  - moved bandpass-filter and frequency offset correction from OFDM
    module in Frequency-Sync-Acquisition module,
  - improved bandpass filter for receiver -> better interfere rejection
    BUT: under normal conditions, this filter will degrade the performance
    a little bit since it attenuates the OFDM carriers at the borders a bit
  - store input data vector which is used for frequency offset acquisition
    and output entire data vector when acquisition was successful -> speeds
    up audio output when re-synchronization is needed
  - fixed problem with high CPU utilization when no DRM signal was received
  - WINDOWS: make the software more robust against high CPU utilization by
    other applications by increasing the thread priority of the Dream signal
    processing thread
  - bug fix: time sync Hilbert filter must be shifted to virtual intermediate
    frequency
  - added informations about robustness mode, MSC scheme, protection
    levels in log long (a log file which is generated parallel to the
    standard log file (compatible to the DRM software radio))
  - display sample rate offset in ppm, too
  - do not show mode , protection levels and MSC constellation in log long
    until FAC CRC was correct
  - resize windows fix for Linux by Andrea Russo
  - add name of picture in tool-tip (in case a MOTSlideShow picture is shown).
    The tool-tip is shown when the user moves the mouse over the picture
  - Journaline pages can be saved as HTML (patch from Andrea Russo)
  - added preview for stations dialog, thanks to Andrea Russo for his patch!
    A new menu was added for setting the preview time. If a DRM transmitter
    will transmit no later than the preview time but is not active, an orange
    marker is shown next to this transmission (in the list)
  - improved averaging of estimation of impulse response: the time shift is
    considered more exactly (sample rate offset estimation should be
    improved, too)
  - added new column to stations list showing the days the transmission is
    active. This code is based on a patch by Andrea Russo
  - added Weighted Modulation Error Ratio (WMER) and MER calculation based
    on the MSC cells. The values are shown in the evaluation dialog
  - added SDC data entity type 3 (information is not used right now) and some
    more error checking
  - added SDC data entity type 4 (information is not used right now)
  - added SDC type 7 (not used right now)
  - added class for storing alternative frequencies transmitted in SDC type 3
  - store plot type selection for evaluation dialog

1.2.2
  - Lots of changes for AM demodulation: a separate main window for AM, noise reduction,
    PLL and CW demodulation, changed AM bandpass filter
  - SNR spectrum plot implemented in DRM-mode, which information is used to improve
    reception under interference situations
  - Added history plots for SNR/Audio, Delay/Doppler and Frequency/Sample Rate
  - Small improvements and bug fixes
