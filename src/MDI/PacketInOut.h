 * Description:
 *	This defines some pure abstract base classes. A CPacketSink is anything that can receive a
 *  packet, while a CPacketSource is anything that can produce packets.
 *  It's intended to be used for DCP packets although it could be used for IPIO as well.
 *
 *  A CPacketSocket is both a source and a sink, and is used to wrap up a concrete socket
 *  implementation such as QSocket or CSocket.
 *
 *  The intention is that this could be expanded to support RS232 and file as sources and sinks
 *  of DCP packets. The File version should support the FF (file framing) layer of DCP,
 *  by defining a new CTagPacketDecoder subclass and CTagItemDecoder subclasses.
